# RC_CNN_HIV
Integrating Multi-View Feature Extraction and Fuzzy Rank-Based Ensemble for Accurate HIV-1 Protease Cleavage Site Prediction

First, apply RC.py for feature extraction on 764, 1625, schllingData, and impensData. Then the extracted data will be used in a Fuzzy Rank-Based Ensemble using CNN (RC_CNN_HIV.py) for final prediction.
