# RC_CNN_HIV
Integrating Multi-View Feature Extraction and Fuzzy Rank-Based Ensemble for Accurate HIV-1 Protease Cleavage Site Prediction

To begin, utilize the RC.py script to perform feature extraction on the datasets 764Data, 1625Data, schillingData, and impensData. Subsequently, employ the extracted data as input for a Fuzzy Rank-Based Ensemble, employing the CNN architecture, as outlined in the RC_CNN_HIV.py script, to make the ultimate predictions.
